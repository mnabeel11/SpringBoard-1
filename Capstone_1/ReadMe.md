Capstone Project 1: In this project, the following machine learning algorithms and techniques were applied:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
XG-Boost
ADA-Boost
Logistic Regression
Ensemble
Bagging
Feature Engineering
The code for the above-mentioned algorithms is shown in the notebook below: https://github.com/taha-shahid/SpringBoard/blob/master/Capstone_1/Capstone_IDAnalysis_MachineLearning.ipynb

The data story for the project is shown in the notebook below: https://github.com/taha-shahid/SpringBoard/blob/master/Capstone_1/Capstone_Data_Storytelling.ipynb

The inferential statistics for the project is shown in the notebook below: https://github.com/taha-shahid/SpringBoard/blob/master/Capstone_1/Inferential_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb

Results: After applying all the algorithms mentioned above on the default of credit card clients, XG-Boost was found to be the best to predict if the client will default or not. XG-Boost gave an accuracy of 82 %.
